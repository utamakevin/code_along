# there are two types of function in js

# synchronous 
synchronous function mean running and finishing the function in the same timeline in order beofre movinf on to another task

# asynchronous 
asynchronous functions mean that functions can start, run in the background without distubring other activities to proceed, and resume later if needes, we can move on to another task before it finishes.

js wait for external inputs and outputs they seem to be asynchronous
