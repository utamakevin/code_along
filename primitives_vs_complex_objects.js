=== in complex data types, it does not compare with one another

let arr1 = [1,2,3]
let arr2 = [1,2,3]

arr1 === arr2 //false
arr1 == arr2 //false


//address location is different - separate copies
let arr1 = [1,2,3]
let arr2 = arr1
//still not the same. assigning like this is will only assigning another name with similar value, but they are still considered different.
